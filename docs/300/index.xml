The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.
Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity.</description></item><item><title>342. Power of Four</title><link>https://ramsayleung.github.io/leetcode_book/docs/300/342_power_of_four/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Apr 2022 22:57:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://ramsayleung.github.io/leetcode_book/docs/300/342_power_of_four/</guid><description>1 Description # source: https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-four/
Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of four. Otherwise, return false.
An integer n is a power of four, if there exists an integer x such that n == 4^x.
Example 1:
Input: n = 16 Output: true Example 2:
Input: n = 5 Output: false Example 3:
Input: n = 1 Output: true Constraints:
-2^31 &amp;lt;= n &amp;lt;= 2^31 - 1</description></item><item><title>374. Guess Number Higher or Lower</title><link>https://ramsayleung.github.io/leetcode_book/docs/300/374_guess_number_higher_or_lower/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2022 13:09:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://ramsayleung.github.io/leetcode_book/docs/300/374_guess_number_higher_or_lower/</guid><description>1 Description # source: https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.
You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:
-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.</description></item></channel></rss>
